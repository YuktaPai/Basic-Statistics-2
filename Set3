# Auditors at a small community bank randomly sample 100 withdrawal transactions made during the week at an ATM machine located near the bankâ€™s main branch. Over the past 2 years, the average withdrawal amount has been $50 with a standard deviation of $40. Since audit investigations are typically expensive, the auditors decide to not initiate further investigations if the mean transaction amount of the sample is between $45 and $55. What is the probability that in any given week, there will be an investigation?
# A. 1.25%     B. 2.5%       C. 10.55%      D. 21.1%          E. 50%

# Answer  C. 10.55
# Probability that there will be no investigation is if 45<sample mean<55
# Code snippet:
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
x1 = 45
x2 = 55
mean = 50
sig = 40
Prob1 = stats.norm.cdf(x1,mean,sig)
Prob2 = ( stats.norm.cdf(x2,mean,sig)-stats.norm.cdf(x1,mean,sig))
print('The probability that there will be no investigation is ', Prob2*100)
